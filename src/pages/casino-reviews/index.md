## Trusted Guide Since 1998
Are you located in New Jersey? If so, count yourself damn lucky. The US has pretty much shut down online gambling in the US – BUT – the State of New Jersey has a number of upstanding casinos connected to their land based brethren.

And the great new is that you aren’t limited to RTG or Betsoft, or some rinky-dink bullshit software provider located in the Ukraine or some other dodgy jurisdiction.

At the following casinos you have Netent – one of the leading slot developers that is focused on the European gambler and have really swept the online scene in both the EU and the UK. You will not find these slots in your local landbased casino. And believe me, the quality of their games outshine most of their US competitors like IGT, and Scientific Games. You need to give them a go, and you will see what I mean.

They also feature your IGT slots – these you will find in Atlantic City – but here you can play them from your home, or even you phone. How awesome is that.

Nextgen – most of their games are only found online in Europe an in the UK. Like Netent, these are excellent games – they even have the Casinomeister Slot game where you can jail the Rogues! It is a fantastic game that our forum members and I helped develop.

And of course there are the Scientific Games (was WMS) which are some of my personal favorites like Spartacus Gladiator of Rome, and other Colossal Reels slots.

And then you have Bally, and other US based slot developers.

The bottom line is that you have these games available via properly regulated casinos based in your home state, New Jersey. Licensed, secure, and are accountable to your state’s rules and regs on preventing problem gaming and fraudulent activity.

If you aren’t in New Jersey and would like to play at these casinos, then visit. You need to have a New Jersey based IP (no cheating via proxies – that is breaking the law), so they are open to tourists and visitors from out of state.

Enjoy – and good luck!
